# Introduction

**js-text-tools** is just a little collection of tools for modifying text. It can be used either in the command line or in JS projects.

# Installation

To use in the command line:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jrc03c/js-text-tools.js
cd js-text-tools
npm link
```

Or to use in Node or the browser:

```bash
npm install --save https://github.com/jrc03c/js-text-tools.js
```

# Usage

In Node or the browser:

```js
const {
  camelify,
  indent,
  kebabify,
  snakeify,
  unindent,
  wrap,
} = require("@jrc03c/js-text-tools")
```

In the command line:

```bash
camelify "Hello, world!"
# helloWorld

kebabify "Hello, world!"
# hello-world

snakeify "Hello, world!"
# hello_world

# wrap the lines in somefile.txt at 80 characters and write the results out to
# a new file called somefile-wrapped.txt
wrap somefile.txt 80 somefile-wrapped.txt
```

# API

## `camelify(text)`

Returns the text in camel-case.

```js
camelify("Hello, world!")
// helloWorld
```

## `indent(text, n, character=" ")`

Returns the text with all lines indented by `n` Ã— `character`. By default, `character` is a space.

```js
indent("Hello, world!", 2, "\t")
// \t\tHello, world!
```

## `kebabify(text)`

Returns the text in kebab-case.

```js
kebabify("Hello, world!")
// hello-world
```

## `snakeify(text)`

Returns the text in snake-case.

```js
snakeify("Hello, world!")
// hello_world
```

## `unindent(text)`

Returns the text with all lines unindented by the same number of characters. For example, if the _smallest_ amount of indentation is 4 spaces, then each line will be unindented by 4 spaces.

For example, suppose I have a file called `message.txt` with this content:

```
    Hello, world!
      My name is Josh.
        What's your name?
```

The smallest amount of indentation in the file is 4 spaces. So, unindenting it will move all lines to the left by 4 spaces.

```js
const { unindent } = require("@jrc03c/js-text-tools")
const fs = require("fs")
const message = fs.readFileSync("message.txt", "utf8")
const unindentedMessage = unindent(message)
fs.writeFileSync("unindented-message.txt", unindentedMessage, "utf8")
```

The contents of `unindented-message.txt` would be:

```
Hello, world!
  My name is Josh.
    What's your name?
```

**NOTE:** The `unindent` function does _not_ pay attention to whether indentation consists of spaces or tabs. It only cares whether or not a character is a whitespace character. It also makes no attempt to make the whitespace characters consistent (i.e., it doesn't try to begin each line with _all_ spaces or _all_ tabs); it merely removes the minimum number of whitespace characters from each line and returns the result.

## `wrap(text, maxLineLength)`

Returns the text with all lines wrapped to a maximum length of `maxLineLength`. By default, the `maxLineLength` is 80. Note that this function only wraps at spaces; it does not wrap mid-word, and it does not attempt to hyphenate words.

```js
wrap("Hello, world! My name is Josh. What's your name?", 10)
/*
Hello,
world! My
name is
Josh.
What's
your name?
*/
```
