# Introduction

**varify.js** makes it easy to convert text to variable names. I needed this for a work project, so I whipped it up real quick.

# Installation

To use in the command line:

```bash
npm install -g https://github.com/jrc03c/varify.js
```

Or to use in a project:

```bash
npm install --save https://github.com/jrc03c/varify.js
```

# Usage

In the command line:

```bash
camel "Hello, world!"
# helloWorld

kebab "Hello, world!"
# hello-world

snake "Hello, world!"
# hello_world
```
